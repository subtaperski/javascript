Open channel flow is the flow of a liquid with a free surface, such as rivers, canals, streams, and pipes. Open channel flow is different from closed conduit flow, where the liquid is completely enclosed by a solid boundary, such as pipes and ducts. Open channel flow is influenced by gravity, friction, slope, and shape of the channel, as well as by external factors such as wind, waves, and tides.
 
Open channel hydraulics is the branch of hydraulics that deals with the analysis and design of open channel flow systems. Open channel hydraulics involves the application of fluid mechanics principles, such as conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, to solve problems related to open channel flow. Some of the common problems in open channel hydraulics are: determining the flow rate, depth, velocity, and pressure of the liquid; designing the optimal cross-section and alignment of the channel; calculating the hydraulic resistance and losses; predicting the changes in flow conditions due to obstructions, transitions, and controls; and modeling the dynamic behavior of unsteady flow.
 
Open channel hydraulics is an important subject for hydraulic engineers, who are responsible for designing and managing water resources projects that involve open channel flow. Some of the examples of such projects are: irrigation and drainage systems; flood control and mitigation structures; hydroelectric power plants; navigation channels and locks; water supply and distribution networks; wastewater treatment and disposal facilities; and environmental restoration and protection measures. Open channel hydraulics is also relevant for other disciplines that deal with water-related issues, such as civil engineering, environmental engineering, agricultural engineering, geotechnical engineering, and coastal engineering.
